# Programming Language Project
CS330-Summer 2022

## History
1)	What is the name of your language? **C++**

2)	When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need? **C++ was created in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup. The C programming language already existed, and C++ was seen as an extension particularly to handle classes and inheritance.** 

3)	What types of programming is your language primarily used for? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different project it’s been used for. **C++ is an OOP, multi-purpose and is used for a wide variety of tasks. Everything from operating systems, to games, aircraft/spaceship software, etc. The list is rather lengthy!** 

4)	Where will you get information about this language when it’s time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLS, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.  **I will mostly use the textbook “Starting out with C++” by Tony Gaddis, GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/?ref=shm) , and the official C++ documentation found on Microsoft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170).**
 
## Getting Started
1)	What did you need to do to install the language? **Since C++ is a complied language, first install a compiler (MINGW84). The compiler will take your source code and compile it to machine code in order to successfully execute a program. The next thing to install is an IDE.**
2)	Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you’ll be using? T**he most recommended programming environment is Visual Studio. This IDE will allow you to build and run your code within one environment.**
3)	How do you run programs in that language? **If using Visual Studio, you will start a new project (I recommend a console app), write your source code, then hit Ctrl+F5 to build and run the program.**
4)	How do you write comments in your language? Comments in C++ are initiated with //. Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */
